# Abhijeet S Pachpute

Software Engineer with strong fundamentals in backend systems, data structures, and system design, with hands-on experience building reliable, production-grade software and applied AI systems.

MS in Computer Science @ University of Utah (May 2026).

I’ve worked across software engineering, applied AI, and security — building backend and full stack systems with a focus on clean architecture, performance, and measurable impact. I use modern AI tools to enhance real systems, not to ship demos.

## Focus
- Backend and distributed systems
- System design, scalability, and performance engineering
- Applied AI and ML systems (agent-based workflows, RAG, inference pipelines, evaluation)
- Writing clean, reliable, well-documented code

## What I’m working on
- End-to-end projects with production-style engineering: testing, CI, observability, and documentation
- Deepening fundamentals in system design, concurrency, databases, and performance tuning
- Open to Software Engineering and related roles 2026 new grad roles (US)

## Experience snapshot
- Software Engineering internships building backend services and production features
- AI engineering experience shipping GenAI tools used by real stakeholders
- Strong grounding in algorithms, operating systems, databases, and security

## Featured work
Pinned repositories highlight projects that emphasize:
- End-to-end system design
- Measurable performance or reliability improvements
- Practical use of AI in real workflows

## Tech
**Languages:** Python, Java, C/C++, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL  
**Backend:** REST APIs, authentication, databases, caching, concurrency, testing  
**Web:** React.js, Node.js, Next.js, HTML/CSS, Tailwind  
**Infra:** Docker, AWS, Linux, CI/CD  
**ML:** PyTorch, CNNs, embeddings, retrieval, evaluation pipelines
